list as abstract data type
static list can:
store a given number of elements of a given data-type
write/modigy element at a position
read element at a position

new dynamic list:
empty list has 0
insert 
remove
count
read/write/modify element at a position
specify data-type

cost of operations
access-read/write element at an index -> constant time O(1)
Insert -> O(n)
Remove -> O(n)
Add -> O(n)

bad use of memory -> better linked lists
